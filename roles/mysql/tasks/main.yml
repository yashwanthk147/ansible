#Setup MySQL Repo
#    # echo '' > /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo
#
#    Install MySQL
#    # yum install mysql-community-server -y
#
#    Start MySQL.
#    # systemctl enable mysqld
#    # systemctl start mysqld
#
#    Now a default root password will be generated and given in the log file.
#    # grep temp /var/log/mysqld.log

#    # curl -s -L -o /tmp/mysql.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/mysql/archive/main.zip"
#    Load the schema for Services.
#
#    # cd /tmp
#    # unzip mysql.zip
#    # cd mysql-main
#  # mysql -uroot -pRoboShop@1 <shipping.sql
